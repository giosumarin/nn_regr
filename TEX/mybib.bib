  abstract = {Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art
neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image
classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified
Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU
improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little
overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that
particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to
train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate
deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks
(PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012
classification dataset. This is a 26% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014
winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66%). To our knowledge, our result is the first to surpass
human-level performance (5.1%, Russakovsky et al.) on this visual recognition
challenge.},
